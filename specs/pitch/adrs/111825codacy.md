# ADR: Adopt Codacy for Automated Code Quality Checks

## Context

Our team is adding CSS, HTML, and JavaScript linting to improve code quality. While ESLint and Stylelint catch many issues locally and in CI, we also want an easy way to:

* run automated quality checks on every PR
* maintain consistent style across contributors
* avoid spending time setting up complex tooling
* provide a simple dashboard for the teaching staff

We need a cloud-based code quality tool with **minimal configuration and low setup overhead**.

## Decision

We will adopt **Codacy** as our automated code quality service.

**Team Members Involved:** Andrew Pan, Boqi Zhu
**Date:** 11/18/2025

## Why Codacy?

Codacy offers the right balance between usefulness and simplicity for our timeline.

### Reasons We Chose Codacy

* **Very easy to set up** (one-click GitHub integration)
* **Zero infrastructure overhead** — no config files required to start
* **Automatic detection** of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS issues
* **Built-in support for ESLint/Stylelint rules**
* **Provides PR comments automatically**
* **Simple dashboard** that lets the professor/TA quickly review code quality
* **Lightweight** compared to CodeClimate, which requires more configuration

### Why Not CodeClimate?

CodeClimate is more powerful for long-term maintainability (complexity scores, duplication, etc.),
but:

* requires more YAML config
* takes more time to customize
* more overhead for our short project timeline

Given our schedule, Codacy gives us 90% of the benefits with 10% of the effort.

## Alternatives Considered

| Tool                      | Why Not Used                                                                        |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CodeClimate**           | Too much configuration; slower to set up; more suitable for long-term product teams |
| **Only ESLint/Stylelint** | No PR integration, no summary dashboard, no automated reporting                     |
| **SonarCloud**            | Overkill for our project size and requires more setup                               |

## Outcome

Codacy will run automatically on all Pull Requests to enforce baseline code quality.
ESLint and Stylelint remain our local + CI linters, but Codacy provides a second layer of automated review with minimal overhead.

## Status

**Planning for future adoption**
Once the CI pipeline and core functionality stabilize, we will integrate Codacy to enhance automated code quality reviews.
