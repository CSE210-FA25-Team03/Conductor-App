# ADR: Use ESLint for Linting

## Context

Our Conductor App uses JavaScript, and multiple team members will be contributing code. We need a simple, consistent way to catch mistakes and keep the code style uniform.

## Decision

- We will use **ESLint** as our linter.

- Team Members Involved: Andrew Pan, Boqi Zhu

- Date: 11/18/2025

## Why ESLint?

* Widely used and well-supported in the JavaScript ecosystem
* Easy to configure for our needs
* Works with VSCode, npm, and CI/CD Pipeline
* Has many useful plugins
* Helps keep code consistent across the whole team

## Alternatives

* **JSHint/JSLint**: older and less flexible
* **Prettier alone**: formatting only, not real linting
