# **ADR: Use ESLint for Linting**

## **Context**

Our Conductor App is built primarily with JavaScript, and multiple team members are contributing code across the backend and frontend.
To maintain consistency, catch common mistakes early, and reduce review overhead, we need a standardized linting tool that enforces code quality and style across the entire project.

## **Decision**

We will adopt **ESLint** as the primary JavaScript linter for both the backend and frontend.

## **Why ESLint?**

* Highly popular and well-supported in the JavaScript ecosystem
* Flexible rule configuration suitable for both backend (Node.js) and browser environments
* Integrates seamlessly with VSCode, npm scripts, and GitHub Actions CI
* Supports plugins and presets for many frameworks and coding styles
* Automatically detects common issues such as unused variables, undefined identifiers, and potential runtime bugs
* Helps maintain consistent style across all contributors

## **Alternatives**

* **JSHint / JSLint** – older tools with fewer customization options and weaker community support
* **Prettier alone** – handles formatting only; does not detect logical errors, unused variables, or code smells
